                    <h3>Credit Card Fraud</h3>
                    <p>Credit card fraud happens when someone steals your card details and uses them to make unauthorized transactions. This can occur through phishing emails, fake websites, or data breaches where financial information gets leaked. Scammers also use skimming devices on ATMs and POS machines to capture card data. Many victims realize it only after seeing unexpected transactions on their bank statements. Always enable transaction alerts and avoid sharing OTPs with anyone.</p>

                    <p>Cyberbullying is the use of digital platforms to harass, threaten, or humiliate someone. It includes sending hateful messages, spreading false rumors, sharing private photos without consent, or publicly shaming someone online. Victims often face mental stress, anxiety, and social isolation. This is common on social media, messaging apps, and online forums. Indian laws, such as the IT Act and IPC, penalize cyberbullying, and victims can report incidents to cybercrime cells or helplines.</p>

This includes sextortion (threatening to leak intimate photos), DDoS attacks on businesses, and ransomware that encrypts files. Attackers often demand payment in cryptocurrency to avoid tracking. Many small businesses and individuals fall victim, with some paying repeatedly as attackers keep demanding more.</p>

This includes sending threatening messages, spreading false information, or tracking someone’s activities without their consent. Many cyberstalkers use fake profiles to target victims, especially women. The psychological impact on victims can be severe, causing anxiety and fear. Indian laws provide protection, and complaints can be filed with cybercrime cells.</p>

                    <p>A data breach occurs when unauthorized individuals gain access to confidential information, such as personal details, passwords, or financial data. This often happens due to weak security systems in organizations or phishing attacks on users. Cybercriminals sell stolen data on the dark web, leading to financial fraud and identity theft. Companies are required to take strong security measures to protect customer data from such breaches.</p>

                    <p>Digital piracy refers to the illegal copying, distribution, or downloading of copyrighted content like movies, music, software, and books without permission. Websites offering free or cracked versions of paid content violate intellectual property laws. This harms creators, industries, and governments by causing revenue losses. Many countries, including India, have strict laws against piracy, with penalties including heavy fines and imprisonment. Legal streaming and licensed software help combat this issue.</p>

Victims, hoping for a good job, end up losing money. Most fake job offers come with unrealistic salaries or require payments before hiring. Always verify job offers directly with the company and never transfer money for job applications.</p>

                    <p>Identity theft happens when someone steals your personal information, like Aadhaar number, PAN card details, or banking credentials, to commit fraud. Criminals use this stolen data to open bank accounts, take loans, or even impersonate you online. This often happens through phishing emails, fake calls, or data breaches. Victims may face financial losses, legal trouble, or damage to their reputation. To stay safe, never share sensitive details, use strong passwords, and enable two-factor authentication for extra security.</p>
